The issue was due to a specificity conflict between selectors. The more specific selector was overriding the intended background color style. The solution involved refactoring the CSS to improve selector specificity and ensure the intended style is applied.  This was achieved by making the intended style more specific using a more precise selector and by removing unnecessary selectors.
