The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when applying a specific style to an element with a particular class. The style is supposed to change the background color of the element, but the change is not reflected in the browser. The code includes a complex nested structure of selectors and media queries, making it difficult to isolate the source of the problem.  The issue appears only in Chrome browser.
